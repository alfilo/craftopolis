    <h2>About Craftopolis</h2>
    <p>
      Hello!  My name is Alina.  Last year, I participated in girl
      scouts and 4H and we did a lot of crafting projects.  So, I 
      thought I’d like to sell some at the Lansing Artisan Fair.  I 
      made some crafts from patterns, and some I made up on my own.</p>

    <p>My goal is not only to sell crafts, but also to inspire others 
       to make their own.  Many of the crafts I don't sell turn into 
       teaching tools for 4-H, or I give them away over the holidays 
       as presents.
    </p>

    <p>All funds raised will go toward buying beads and supplies for
      next year’s artisan fair, and any profit will be put towards
      raising money for college.  Hope you find something inspiring at
      this year's Lansing Artisan Fair!</p>
