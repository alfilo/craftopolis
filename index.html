    <h2>About Craftopolis</h2>
    <p>
      Hello!  My name is Alina.  The last few years, I
      participated in 4-H and we did a lot of crafting
      projects.  So, I  thought I’d like to start my
      own business selling the crafts I make.  Some
      crafts I make from patterns, and many are my own
      original designs.  The crafts I make are often
      exhibited at the Tompkins County 4-H Fair and New
      York State Fair.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is not only to sell crafts, but to inspire
      others to make their own.  Many of the crafts that
      I don't sell become teaching tools for 4-H, or I
      give them away throughout the season as presents.
    </p>

    <p>
      All funds raised will go toward buying beads and
      supplies for next year’s sales, and any profit will
      be put towards raising money for college or community
      service projects.  Hope you find something inspiring
      at this year's sale!</p>
